- Hi. I'm a recent CS Associates graduate based in Metro Vancouver looking to improve my portfolio.
- I have experience programming in Python and Java. I am learning JavaScript and C++.
- I have halfway created a text based RPG on Java (game mechanics have been done, need to finish the story and enemies).
